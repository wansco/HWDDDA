# HWDDDA
Processing code for data gathered through the HWDDDA project

## Data
Sample data files can be found in /data
Full test runs are confidential and available to members of the project as per the HWDDDA contracts and agreements.

## Processing Code
Preliminary processing code is available as a Jupyter notebook in the /processor folder. The intent of this repository is to better collaborate with member companies in the parsing, processing and analysis of the gathered data.

The jupyter notebook can be found at:
